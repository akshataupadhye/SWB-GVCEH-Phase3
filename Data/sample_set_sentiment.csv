1259,VictoriaBC,City Council opposes efforts to increase housing supply,"[Link to article: In Fairfield, plans for small lot face political scrutiny](http://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/in-fairfield-plans-for-small-lot-face-political-scrutiny-1.2361236)

Note: Hope it's okay to post this TC article, I couldn't find another source. Also, the original article title is not very descriptive - I don't think mine is misleading or inaccurate.

There have been a lot of threads about the housing market - here's one about an issue that I found kind of infuriating, as it shows how council is actively obstructing one of the few practical solutions that could mitigate the problem.

Given the problems with housing supply in Victoria, I've always thought that it was crazy how huge the yards of so many houses are. Many are big enough to easily fit 2 or 3 houses, which is what they do in places like Japan or many European cities. 

So why don't more people divide up lots and build more houses? I thought it was because it wasn't economically feasible (although with prices now I'm pretty sure it would be), but apparently the actual reason is red tape.

The linked article is about a large lot that a developer wants to subdivide into 3 small lots - building 3 houses where there was only one. 

Apparently, city council is against this because the houses that would be built would be new and therefore too expensive.

'“There isn’t an acute housing need in our community for houses that are going to be priced where these three new homes will be,” said Coun. Ben Isitt, who was against sending the proposal to public hearing.
(...)
“We need new housing at the lower end of the spectrum, not higher up,” he said.'

I don't see how more housing can be created without the houses being 'new'? I guess tents are the way to achieve that?

In the article, council members also talk about the ""threat"" of redevelopment, and how the two immediate neighbours are in opposition. As usual, they side with a couple complainers rather than the interests of the city as a whole (speed limit reductions on Bay St. are another example of this).

They also say: ""it is reasonable for neighbours to expect a form of development consistent with “what’s been in the neighbourhood for 100 years""'. As for Helps, she is concerned with the ""housing ecosystem"".

Is it just me, or it this insane and stupid? Is having smaller lots really such a devastating thing for a community?

It seems obvious that building more houses on smaller lots would increase supply, pulling down prices for everyone. I guess the council is too extreme left to believe in basic supply and demand?","City Council opposes efforts to increase housing supply.

Earlier this week I got an email where they state that they must either start requiring the passport or be shut down. 

During the past month I chose to go to Winchester, have a pint and wait for all this to blow over, so I tested the policy yesterday by going in normally without showing the passport, and to my pleasure the front desk does indeed require it now.

383,VictoriaBC,Local submissions to the Committee for Reforming the Police Act,"[VicPD's submission](https://www.leg.bc.ca/content/CommitteeDocuments/42nd-parliament/2nd-session/rpa/2021_07_27_AM/Victoria-Police-Department_Submission.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2dSzBtbm1B5qE4B46oaAPWnbS00uh6BdTikF4eBCEkiKFX7aHxqClMsHU)  

Some excerpts:    


**Police oversight**  

>We support the creation of a single regulatory oversight body (i.e. combine the IIO and OPCC) that may include the capacity to conduct the investigations themselves. This is a way to reduce the number of overlapping oversight processes, and ensures there is financial accountability to oversight decisions.   
>  
>We support an oversight system based on understanding, mutual benefits, and corrective measures over punitive sanctions. Mediation and conflict resolution should be the primary process except in serious cases. What should be considered “serious” should be defined and consistently applied. We highly encourage oversight processes that permit a streamlined approach for early resolution. Often, full investigations on less serious matters or matters result in delay, unnecessary costs, and do not serve the public interest.   
>  
>While extremely rare, serious police misconduct is most often detected by police agencies themselves, properly reported, and vigorously investigated with oversight in place. This must be recognized. Oversight is critical, but is focused on what has already occurred. We strongly recommend some reallocation of the high costs for oversight toward training and prevention.

**Governance**  

>Review the suitability of mayors holding the statutory position as chair of a police board. It is our view that mayors should not serve as police board chairpersons.   
>  
>Strengthen the independence of police boards and ensure improved understanding of both municipal councils and police boards regarding the powers and responsibilities of each.   
>  
>Set out in legislation defining features of adequate and effective policing in a municipality inclusive of what kinds of preventative services ought to be expected. This will assist police boards and councils in individual decision making and ensure consistency of services between municipalities.   
>  
>Consider a refreshed system of public safety funding to reduce tension surrounding costs.  
>  
>Establish a provincially accepted set of police performance measures against which all BC police services can report on regularly.   
>  
>Avoid US based concepts of direct city/mayor oversight and direction to police.   
>  
>Establish provincial policing standards for assessing police officer staffing levels in a municipality.  

**Police Service Delivery Models**  

>We recommend the province take a leadership role in the structure of policing services and consider leading regionalization where it is likely to result in an overall benefit to the public. We believe that policing and the public in Greater Victoria would benefit from a single, regional police service. A regional police service would require a funding and governance structure, perhaps based on the regional districts model, that addresses funding formulae, voting rights, and other critical governance responsibilities.   
>  
>The policing structure in Greater Victoria is inefficient and unfair. VicPD receives constant criticism related to costs of policing when the reality is that a small tax base supports policing related to the bulk of the regions serious crime, and high call volumes. Often cited statistics on costs of policing are misleading and fail to acknowledge the inefficient system in the Greater Victoria area.   
>  
>While integration of some services has been beneficial, integrated units’ governance can have inefficiencies due, in part, to the tendency for parties to act in the individual best interests of their respective agencies/municipalities. This is an area for consideration with the expansion of integrated policing models. 

**Mental Health, Addictions, Homelessness, and Social Challenges**  

>Recognize that police services have, and will continue to have, a very important role in the community response to complex social challenges. The elevated role of police in recent years has been the result of the lack of effective upstream investments in preventative healthcare.   
>  
>While police ought not be the de-facto response to mental health related incidents in the community in all cases, police are, and will remain, an important part of the response to mental health crises where there is a real or perceived immediate or potential threat to public safety (actual or potential criminality, presence of weapons, violence or threats of violence) or as statute requires (i.e. apprehension authority under the Mental Health Act).   
>  
>Appropriate funding, staffing, training, and resources for police must continue to be part of the available mental health response resources in communities. Improve capacity and legal authorities to facilitate mandatory information sharing between health and police, while maintaining the very important focus on privacy considerations. Each resource possesses important information that will assist the other, facilitating better outcomes for members of the public.     
>  
>It is critical for adequate funding of health authorities to ensure appropriate proactive and reactive response in communities. Upstream mental health and addictions services will reduce the downstream impacts to front-line emergency services, including police.     
>  
>It is important to understand; however, that even very effective upstream programs will only reduce, not eliminate, the need for police involvement in response to public safety concerns. Police involvement in preventative and reactive response to mental health within specialized services (Assertive Community Treatment, Assertive Outreach, Crisis Response) have been proven in research to be effective. Investments in police participation in these models should be expanded as part of a comprehensive healthcare system.

>  
>This fall, the province will be in the final stages of its Police Act review. We hope that this review will bring about much-needed modernization of law enforcement. We also hope it will meaningfully address the role that police have come to play as a de facto part of the health-care system.  
>  
>Many of our residents across urban British Columbia are suffering from mental-health and substance-use issues and, increasingly, brain injury.  
>  
>Added to this is a toxic drug supply, growing homelessness, and increasing stigma and anger. This crisis is putting enormous strain on our police departments and RCMP detachments, and it’s stretching municipal budgets already affected by COVID-19.  
>  
>The current police-respond-first approach to mental-health and substance-use calls doesn’t adequately address the reality of the complex needs in our communities for people who continue to fall through the cracks.  
>  
>Because there aren’t enough resources available to address mental health, addictions, homelessness and vulnerable residents requiring complex care, police are frequently called upon to attend to residents struggling with mental-health and substance-use issues. This leads to an expensive download of health-related costs to police, and therefore to local governments.  
>  
>In 2021, Kelowna Regional RCMP will respond to an estimated 4,900 mental-health-related calls, compared with 2,800 in 2016. Between mid-2017 and mid-2021, Victoria has seen an increase from 17.7 per cent to 25.4 per cent of incidents attended by police where the attending officers assessed deteriorated mental health as being a factor in the matter giving rise to police attendance.  
>  
>The magnitude of these types of calls across all our communities strains the primary functions of police. Police are being used to fill the gaps where urgent social support and health care are required.  
>  
>This takes them away from more appropriate front-line responsibilities, such as foot patrols and being out on the streets connecting with the community. It also leaves less time to fight serious crime through proactive, intelligence-led policing.  
>  
>In addition, using front-line police services to address mental health and substance use can be stigmatizing and perpetuates the criminalization of vulnerable people, while, at the same time, forcing police to deal with calls which other services are better equipped to address.  
>  
>The B.C. Urban Mayors’ Caucus proposes specialized health-care teams as a key solution that will allow our police to go back to policing and will provide vulnerable people with the care they need.  
>  
>Access to mental-health and addiction services needs to be consistent throughout the province and resourced by specialized health care teams available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in the same way our policing system operates.  
>  
>Currently, if someone is having a mental-health episode in one of our downtown streets in the middle of the night, there are no emergency mental health services available, there is no one but police to call.  
>  
>Current models such as Assertive Community Treatment Teams, Assertive Outreach Teams, and the Integrated Mobile Crisis Teams are making progress, but they need increased investment and capacity from the provincial government.  
>  
>Local governments rely primarily on property taxes to fund all services; this is not sustainable, and this funding source cannot meet the existing and growing need. Local governments should not be responsible for health-care provision through policing. In addition, the province should seek ways to fund civilian-led health teams for when police are not required. These teams should be available 24/7.  
>  
>Police can continue to play a role with these teams, but should be actively involved in an incident only at the request of the specialized health team or if there is a risk to public safety. And wellness checks should always be performed by health-care workers who have specialized knowledge and training.  
>  
>In terms of dispatch, having the 911 fire-police-ambulance options as the only choices if someone is in urgent mental distress does not meet the needs of residents in mental-health distress as it most often results in armed police attending health-based situations, which can escalate tensions.  
>  
>Other alternatives — including a fire-police-ambulance- mental health option or an expanded 811 call system — should be considered.  
>  
>We are grateful the province is reviewing the Police Act.

6246,VictoriaBC,"Visitor, possible new Victoria resident wishes to hear from HandyDART drivers","Hi,

My name is Jordan and I live in southern Ontario.
I am coming for a visit to Victoria in early Fall to visit my mother. Though she wants me to move there, at this time I see it as only a visit, but I'm keeping my options open.

I am blind (among other challenges). In Ontario I rely on para-transit services similar to Victoria's HandyDART. I have a couple questions, not so much about the policies and procedures of the service (as officially those can be found online), but more to do with the culture, with respect to how drivers balance protocol with the needs of the ridership. If  some drivers would be willing to chime in and answer these questions, I would be super duper grateful.

As I am not currently moving to the city, my use of HandyDART during my visit will not be for critical work/ business reasons, but rather just trips to places like Tim Horton's to get a feel for how it's going to work and whether or not it suits my needs. In Ontario, when I take trips to such places, they've normally had no issue bringing me from the bus to the service counter (or to the back of the line) on drop-off, and assisting me to the vehicle from a seating area that is visible from the doors on pick-up. As HandyDART drivers, do you find this reasonable? I'm always going to be ready and prompt, but unfortunately I'm not able to see you coming.

My other question deals with no-shows. In most Ontario cities, the policy is that the driver must stay for five minutes, and can leave at their discression if the rider is not fully boarded when that time runs out. Though I can no longer ffind this policy online, HandyDART used to state that it's policy is three minutes. Normally drivers in Ontario come into the building (where I'm seated near the entrance clearly visible from the doors), make themselves known and assist me to the vehicle. I'm told this takes between 2:00 - 2:30 end to end. I pride myself on not judging books by their covers, but a three minute limit sounds like it would be mathematically impossible for some customers who have limited mobility. In my case, a simple mishap such as the elastic in my cane becoming tangled on the way to the bus and needing 30 seconds to right it would put me over the limit. As a driver, do you always leave the second that clock strikes zero no matter how close the rider was to being in the vehicle?

In closing: I know it probably sounds strange to hear someone sweating the small stuff to this extent, but I would be ever grateful to have some input from drivers on how you personally handle these situations.

Thank you,

Jordan.","Visitor, possible new Victoria resident wishes to hear from HandyDART drivers. Hi,

A commentary by a Victoria city councillor.

The City of Victoria is in a ­public-safety crisis. The first step to solving the growing threat to public safety is to acknowledge it as real and take immediate action. If that is not done, it is difficult to see how we can continue to function as a city.

Our police, bylaw and animal-control departments are in crisis. They are understaffed and overworked. The tone from inside these departments is that “we are dropping like flies.”

 The numbers speak for themselves. VicPD has 52 members unable to be deployed due to injury or PTSD, including 17 recruits at the Justice Institute. Hours lost to injury and PTSD tripled since 2018, from 1,051 to 3,361.

It’s getting worse, with assaults on officers, including being knocked unconscious, attacked while volunteering and recently even being struck by a stolen vehicle.

VicPD often runs below minimum staffing numbers for patrol shifts. At one time, ­officers were glad to work overtime, but no more. They are increasingly burnt out and shifts are going unfilled.

The response time for “priority one” calls, such as threat to life or assault, is now 15 minutes.

Chief Del Manak tells council this is “an unacceptable level.” That is an understatement — it is dangerous.

Morale is badly diminished. Numerous sources say from 10 to 18 officers are actively looking to leave VicPD for other departments such as ­Saanich, Oak Bay, Surrey and the RCMP. Several veteran officers recently said they have never seen morale so low.

The union says part of the problem is that VicPD handles more work per officer than any other capital region police department, and those VicPD officers get less pay.

As a front-line officer recently said: “It’s not really about the money. We need ­help. We feel abandoned, underappreciated and everyday face ‘anti-police’ comments. It’s not great right now.”

Throughout the ranks, there is concern that if help doesn’t come soon, surviving the crisis will be next to impossible.

Out of necessity, basic maintenance of public order now rests with city bylaw officers. That department estimates it spends 80 per cent of its time dealing with public safety issues in parks and on the streets, and trying to prevent further encampments.

That leaves little time to deal with a growing list of resident complaints, such as noise, infractions and investigations.

VicPD’s union believes increased provincial shelters and housing programs ­consume much of their resources. Recently the union told the police board that “the situation has become increasingly worse.”

Between June 12 and Sept. 3, the department responded to 2,701 calls for service to these facilities. In comparison, it responded to 973 calls for the entire municipality of Esquimalt.

We all need to step up and advocate that more resources must be allocated to manage the crisis.

The province must take responsibility for downloading the policing and social cost of its housing initiatives onto the city. The province should consider a program such as the Toronto Public Housing one that focuses public safety on supported housing with its own police department, supported by officers who don’t carry guns or tasers.

The province needs to find a way to keep dangerous criminals and repeat serial offenders off our streets and out of the revolving door of crime and arrest and catch and release.

Otherwise, the public is left without hope for improvement, and the police with growing frustration that their work doesn’t matter.

Manak must continue to be bold and courageous and demand what is needed for his department to turn things around. The same goes for the bylaw department.

Council must acknowledge and support our police and bylaw officers while it increases advocacy for mental health and addiction from higher levels of government.

And you must voice your ­support to improve public safety by writing to mayorandcouncil@victoria.ca.

Only if we all work together on this crisis will real change occur.","Stephen Andrew in T/C: Victoria is facing a public-safety crisis. https://www.timescolonist.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-victoria-is-facing-a-public-safety-crisis-1.24361659

661,VictoriaBC,Third-generation landowner wants exemption from speculation tax,"From the TC 

&#x200B;

The third-generation owner of a waterfront property in North Saanich  is urging the province to create an exemption under its speculation and  vacancy tax for long-term owners such as himself.

His property — considered the family homestead — is not being held  for speculation, said retired businessman Malcolm Winspear of Dallas,  Texas.

The intention was always to keep it in the family, said Winspear,  who has a son and a daughter. But he is now weighing whether to hold  onto the site, purchased by his grandfather, philanthropist Francis  Winspear, decades ago.

Malcolm Winspear said it makes sense to grant an exemption from the  tax in cases such as his, based on length of owner­ship. The speculation  and vacancy tax is two per cent of the assessed value of a property.

This year, Winspear, who holds dual Canadian and U.S. citizenship,  and his wife, Jill, were each charged half the total amount of the  speculation tax, which totalled close to $40,000, for their Ardmore  Drive property.

“I’m afraid that it is becoming — now with this tax — so expensive that I may not be able to keep it,” Winspear said.

He anticipates rising property values will see the annual speculation tax reach $50,000.

Within 10 years, it could add up to $500,000 or $1 million over two decades, Winspear said.

The speculation tax does not include other property taxes levied on  property or the cost of upkeep. “It’s become a hugely expensive  property,” he said. “It’s really a case of: Is it appropriate to charge  that kind of money on a property that’s a vacation home?”

B.C.’s speculation and vacancy tax was announced in the 2018 budget,  aimed at reducing the number of empty homes and helping to tackle the a  shortage of affordable housing. It was intended to encourage owners of  vacant homes to offer them for rent or sell them.

The tax — which applies to Greater Victoria, Nanaimo, Lantzville,  Metro Vancouver, the Fraser Valley, Kelowna and West Kelowna — attracted  immediate criticism from affected property owners.

B.C.’s Finance Ministry figures that 32,000 people, or about one per  cent of homeowners, pay the tax. The province collected $115 million in  the 2018-19 fiscal year. Since then, the tax rate on foreign owners and  satellite families increased to two per cent from 0.5 per cent.

Renting is not an option for Winspear because the family wants to  continue having access throughout the year. Other exemptions to the tax  can include major home renovations, divorce, hospitalization and  extended absence.

Typically, the Winspears are at their Ardmore property three or four  months in a year, staying from a week to a month or so at at time, and  hosting other family members. They have been in North Saanich for the  past few months.

The 1940s house is about 2,000 square feet and is like a vacation  cottage, used for family get-togethers and recreation for decades. It is  nothing like mansions built on other Ardmore properties, where  assessments are high, Winspear said.

“If I’m third-generation owner of a property, why am I being charged  with a speculation tax that is intended for vacant properties or  foreign owners who don’t use them?” he said.

The Winspear family and its foundation have donated millions of  dollars to initiatives such as the Mary Winspear Centre in Sidney, the  Bessie Brooks Winspear Music and Media Commons at the University of  Victoria, and, in Edmonton, the Francis Winspear Centre for Music.

Francis Winspear was born in England and moved with his family to  Alberta as a boy, founding a successful accounting firm as an adult. He  died in 1997. Mary Winspear was his sister and Bessie was his wife.

It would be difficult to part with the property, Malcolm Winspear said. “I am very deeply attached to it.”

Winspear has moved a lot during his career. “This is the only place  that’s really been constant my entire life. I call this home. I just  don’t live here enough to avoid paying this tax.”","Third-generation landowner wants exemption from speculation tax. From the TC
