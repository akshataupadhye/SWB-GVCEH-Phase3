Public service members ratify main agreement

Over a two-week voting period, members of the public service bargaining unit voted 53.4% in favour of the tentative agreement reached with your employer, B.C.’s Public Service Agency (PSA), on September 6, 2022. The 19th Main Agreement is now the collective agreement covering your bargaining unit.
 
The vote was conducted and verified by Simply Voting – a secure, independent online voting platform. Voting closed Monday, October 17, 2022 at 5 p.m. Following the close of voting, your Public Service Bargaining Committee joined BCGEU staff and component scrutineers at BCGEU headquarters to receive the final vote count. More than 71% of the 32,600 eligible members in the bargaining unit voted in the ratification process.
 
Highlights of your new three-year agreement include:

A three-year term from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2025.

General wage increases:

Year one (retroactive to April 1, 2022): 25 cent/hour increase, plus 3.24 per cent.

Year two (effective April 1, 2023): A wage increase between 5.5-6.75 per cent calculated based on the annual average Consumer Price Index for B.C.

Year three (effective April 1, 2024): A wage increase between 2-3 per cent increase calculated based on the annual average Consumer Price Index for B.C.

Improvements to occupational health and safety

Improvements to mental health in the workplace

Employment security

Equity and worker’s rights

Improved and more flexible leave provisions

In addition to the main agreement, the component agreements for components 5, 6, 12 and 20 also ratified.

Changes to the agreements with a specified date – like wage increases and Temporary Market Adjustments – are effective as of the stated date. Undated changes take effect at date of ratification.

Your bargaining committee will provide updates when the timing of retroactive wage payments has been determined. Remember, you can find many more helpful resources – including a wage calculator and a detailed summary of the agreement – on this web page.
 
We would like to thank each member who took the time to get educated about the tentative agreement and vote in the ratification.

Attention Residents

NOTICE TO VACATE


Regarding 2770 Claude Road, Langford, British Columbia

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LEASE WITH CENTURION PROPERTY ASSOCIATES INC.

PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY

Dear Resident of RidgeView Place,

 

By way of this bulletin, we are providing you with the difficult but important notice to vacate your unit immediately.

 

We recognize that there is never a convenient time to receive this notice, and for those of you who have been long-time tenants, this may be particularly frustrating. We share your frustrations and apologize for the significant inconvenience this causes, however, our first priority is your safety. We ask Residents to only pack essential items at this time. We’re working diligently to gather additional information and will provide an update by the end of the week.  

 

We recently received notice from the Engineers and Geoscientists of BC (“EGBC”) about serious concerns with certain structural elements of the building. While the EGBC did not recommend evacuations, we immediately retained an independent engineer to visit the site, who identified serious safety concerns and recommended that tenants evacuate.

 

In light of this development, your current contract with Centurion Properties Associates Inc. has been frustrated as of April 24, 2023. This means that under the laws of the Residential Tenancy Act [SBC 2002] Ch. 78 and Frustrated Contract Act [RSBC 1996] Ch. 166, both parties to the contract are relieved from fulfilling their obligations under the contract. Therefore, your tenancy has ceased, along with your rental obligations, and you must vacate your unit.


Additionally, here are some actions we recommend you take immediately:

Contact your tenant insurance provider as parts of your expenses for temporary accommodation and other expenses may be covered by your policy.

Email ridgeview@centurion.ca to provide written notice once you have vacated your unit.


Here are additional supports Centurion is offering:

Centurion will provide each unit with $1,000.00 payable to the leaseholder via cheque or e-transfer as a gesture of compassionate assistance.

All Residents will be reimbursed for your rent between the dates of April 24-30, 2023, and any prepaid rents. All damage and pet deposits will be returned. Arrangements to pick up these funds can be made by contacting the Resident Manager. 

Centurion has multiple buildings in the Langford and Victoria Area and can help assist in relocating you to one of our other buildings with similar accommodation, subject to availability. Centurion’s Customer Care Center is available 7 days a week at 1-844-830-5736. You can also visit our website at www.cpliving.com for the most current availability.

﻿Moving trucks are available Monday, April 24 until 8pm, and Tuesday April 25 9am - 5pm PDT for light items.

Assistance for Residents with special requirements and pets can contact Resident Manager

 

Please be advised that all Residents will be welcome to return to their original unit once the remediation is complete. If this is something you are considering, please let the site staff know and we can contact you directly.

 

At this time, it is still too early to provide a firm update on when work will be completed. We are still collecting information from the engineers for review and there are no firm timelines available. The option of temporary shoring of the garage area is currently being reviewed with the engineers to provide residents safe access to come back and retrieve their belongings. Future communication in this regard will be sent out accordingly.

""","In case anyone was curious about the notice us Ridgeview residents got today. ""April 24, 2023


Attention Residents

NOTICE TO VACATE


Regarding 2770 Claude Road, Langford, British Columbia

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LEASE WITH CENTURION PROPERTY ASSOCIATES INC.

PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY

Dear Resident of RidgeView Place,

 

By way of this bulletin, we are providing you with the difficult but important notice to vacate your unit immediately.

 

We recognize that there is never a convenient time to receive this notice, and for those of you who have been long-time tenants, this may be particularly frustrating. We share your frustrations and apologize for the significant inconvenience this causes, however, our first priority is your safety. We ask Residents to only pack essential items at this time. We’re working diligently to gather additional information and will provide an update by the end of the week.  

 

We recently received notice from the Engineers and Geoscientists of BC (“EGBC”) about serious concerns with certain structural elements of the building. While the EGBC did not recommend evacuations, we immediately retained an independent engineer to visit the site, who identified serious safety concerns and recommended that tenants evacuate.

 

In light of this development, your current contract with Centurion Properties Associates Inc. has been frustrated as of April 24, 2023. This means that under the laws of the Residential Tenancy Act [SBC 2002] Ch. 78 and Frustrated Contract Act [RSBC 1996] Ch. 166, both parties to the contract are relieved from fulfilling their obligations under the contract. Therefore, your tenancy has ceased, along with your rental obligations, and you must vacate your unit.


Additionally, here are some actions we recommend you take immediately:

Contact your tenant insurance provider as parts of your expenses for temporary accommodation and other expenses may be covered by your policy.

Email ridgeview@centurion.ca to provide written notice once you have vacated your unit.


Here are additional supports Centurion is offering:

Centurion will provide each unit with $1,000.00 payable to the leaseholder via cheque or e-transfer as a gesture of compassionate assistance.

All Residents will be reimbursed for your rent between the dates of April 24-30, 2023, and any prepaid rents. All damage and pet deposits will be returned. Arrangements to pick up these funds can be made by contacting the Resident Manager. 

Centurion has multiple buildings in the Langford and Victoria Area and can help assist in relocating you to one of our other buildings with similar accommodation, subject to availability. Centurion’s Customer Care Center is available 7 days a week at 1-844-830-5736. You can also visit our website at www.cpliving.com for the most current availability.

﻿Moving trucks are available Monday, April 24 until 8pm, and Tuesday April 25 9am - 5pm PDT for light items.

Assistance for Residents with special requirements and pets can contact Resident Manager

 

Please be advised that all Residents will be welcome to return to their original unit once the remediation is complete. If this is something you are considering, please let the site staff know and we can contact you directly.

 

At this time, it is still too early to provide a firm update on when work will be completed. We are still collecting information from the engineers for review and there are no firm timelines available. The option of temporary shoring of the garage area is currently being reviewed with the engineers to provide residents safe access to come back and retrieve their belongings. Future communication in this regard will be sent out accordingly.

 


LIABILITY FOR LOSS/DAMAGE or INJURY


We do not accept any liability for loss or damage to any of your belongings or property. This letter serves as official notice for you to vacate the unit immediately. All our contractual obligations have ended as of the date of frustration, namely April 24, 2023.

 

Anyone who chooses to ignore this notice and does not vacate, does so at their own risk and will be deemed to freely accept and fully assume all such risks, dangers and hazards and possibility of personal injury, death, property damage, expense and related loss, including loss of income or property.

File: 21-37601

Victoria, BC – An Integrated Canine Service (ICS) officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries after being head-butted during an arrest early this morning.

Shortly after 2 a.m. this morning VicPD officers were called to the parking lot of a multi-unit temporary housing facility in the 3000-block of Douglas Street for a report of a man kicking the building and smashing glass bottles on the ground. The suspect then left the area. Officers responded to the area and located the suspect in the 2800-block of Douglas Street. However, the suspect fled on bicycle. He was located a short time later in the 500-block of Ellice Street and again fled on a bicycle.

An ICS officer eventually located and arrested the suspect in the 2900-block of Jutland Road after a foot pursuit and a struggle on the ground. The suspect resisted arrest and additional officers were required to take him into custody.

Officers then searched the man near the police vehicle. During the search, the suspect head-butted the ICS officer, causing non-life-threatening injuries. The suspect then spat toward another officer, narrowly missing, while yelling that he was infected with the COVID-19 virus.

The suspect was transported to cells at VicPD where he was later released with a court date and conditions. He will face recommended charges of obstructing a peace officer and assaulting a peace officer.

In British Columbia, the decision to release a person is based on the likelihood they will attend court, the risk posed to public safety, and the impact on confidence in the criminal justice system.  In addition, Bill C-75, which came into effect nationally in 2019, has legislated a “principle of restraint” that requires police to release an accused person at the earliest possible opportunity after considering these factors. This is founded in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that every person has the right to liberty and the presumption of innocence pre-trial.  Police are also asked to consider the circumstances of Indigenous or vulnerable person in the process, in order to address the disproportionate impacts that the criminal justice system has on these populations.

This file remains under investigation.

If you have information about this incident, please call our non-emergency line at (250) 995-7654. To report what you know anonymously, please call Greater Victoria Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.","Officers Head-Butted, Spat At During Arrest. Date: Tuesday, September 14, 2021

66,7611,7611,VictoriaBC,$1-million project for bumpy Quadra segment,"From the Times Colonist today:

Motorists and cyclists bumping along Quadra Street between Rogers Avenue and Nicholson Street since early December will notice some big improvements — but not until May.

That’s when a $1-million tender awarded to G & E Contracting of Saanich to replace sections of water and sewer mains in that section, along with sanitary sewers from McBriar Avenue to Nicholson Street, will be completed and paved over, said district engineering director Harley Machielse.

“The construction has been progressing as anticipated, but the roadway has deteriorated due to winter conditions faster than expected,” Machielse said in an email to the Times Colonist.

Part of the problem is that trenches dug for underground pipes and backfilled with soil have been capped with temporary asphalt patches. That, in combination with cracks caused by continuous freezing and thawing, has left the pavement in poor condition.

“We appreciate the public’s patience while we replace the underground utilities and rehabilitate the road surface,” Machielse said. The full pavement overlay for the approximately four blocks from Rogers to Nicholson is expected to cost about $150,000 and depends on favourable weather conditions.

I had never thought to check how much different drug stores charged for prescriptions until I ended up on a rather inadequate insurance plan. The answer is that they vary a lot! And Pharmasave is expensive - about twice as much as London Drugs.

In the prescription on the left, notice that the London Drugs is for twice the amount, but is only $37 versus $33. In the one on the right, they are for precisely the same prescription. And only a day apart. But the Pharmasave price is more than twice that of London Drugs.

80,3093,3093,VictoriaBC,Who is funding the Pro-Amalgamation movement?,"Serious question.

Where is the Pro-Am getting all its money for billboards, election posters, etc?

I have trouble believing this is a grass-roots movement. 

From all I've read, amalgamation in Canada has resulted in significant cost increases for the same level of government services. (See below for a few examples.)

Contrary to the (quite enticing) ""We can't afford 13 mayors."" sound-byte, the costs for running one City Hall for such a large community would be more than the smaller communities. That's not including the costs associated with converting hundreds of volunteer firefighters into paid firefighters, giving the same proportion of municipal works funding to all communities, etc, etc.

So, who stands to gain? Bureaucrats looking for higher-paying jobs (managing more people)? Developers looking to get mega-rich pushing projects into areas that have refused them already?

**TL;DR:** I haven't seen any evidence that the pro-amalgamation movement is citizen motivated, then who is driving it? Who's paying? Who stands to gain with amalgamation?

------

Amalgamation has been studied fairly well, and while the number of elected officials decreases, the number of bureaucratic jobs greatly increases and costs skyrocket. [Lots of information in this article.](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/01/13/amalgamation_brought_fewer_ontario_cities_but_more_city_workers_report_finds.html)

The mid-90s Ontario amalgamations serve as good examples (they're not all Toronto size, by any means).

Similar cost increases occurred in Halifax and Manitoba.

Over and over again, people who've looked at *actual amalgamations* (especially similar size communities in Canada) agree that, **as the municipality size grows, cost per capita increases**.

There's a good table in [this article](http://www.fcpp.org/pdf/FB%2022%20Reassessing%20Local%20Government%20Amalgamation%20FEB%2004.pdf) which shows government cost per capita within amalgamated cities versus the cost per capita directly around those amalgamated cities. No surprise, almost all of them are *much* greater (a couple were slightly less, but the average is **57% higher costs in amalgamated cities**!).","Who is funding the Pro-Amalgamation movement?.

95,4531,4531,VictoriaBC,Johnson Street bridge builder has filed a lawsuit against the city,"Article from the TC

The new Johnson Street Bridge is built and in use, but legal wrangling over its design and costs continue.
In a lawsuit filed in B.C. Supreme Court, PCL Constructors Westcoast Ltd., the company that built the bridge, maintains design information for the bridge “was not accurate and complete” 

The suit seeking unspecified damages names the city, bridge design consultant WSP Canada Group Ltd. (formerly known as MMM Group), and Hardesty & Hanover, a sub-consultant, as defendants. The statement of claim, filed in Supreme Court in Chilliwack, says the city failed to provide design information in a timely manner, unreasonably changed the design (including specifications), and failed to pay PCL’s costs arising from changes.
Bridge project director Jonathan Huggett, representing the City of Victoria, said the lawsuit has been filed as a type of place-holder to preserve PCL’s right to sue while negotiations with the various parties over the issues continue.

“If you don’t file within two years of knowing something, you’re out of luck. So they haven’t served it on the city. There’s a difference between filing it in Supreme Court and actually serving it. It hasn’t been served on the city, but they have preserved their rights under the statute of limitations to pursue these claims,” Huggett said.
“There’s ongoing discussions with PCL, which I can’t get into for obvious reasons, but at some point we’ll reach a conclusion.
“PCL feel they have a claim. They have filed it to preserve their right to pursue that claim. The city will listen. The city will evaluate them and the city will make a recommendation to council on what should happen based on legal advice, on advice of the consultants,” Huggett said.
He said the same is true of a separate lawsuit filed against the city early in the year over design of the pier fendering, which protects the bridge from marine traffic.
WSP Canada filed a notice of civil claim on Jan. 30 seeking payment of about $300,000 for additional design work for fendering of the bridge’s north piers.
That suit, filed in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver, says that at the direction of the city, the company provided additional professional services related to the design of fendering for which it wasn’t paid.
“It [the lawsuit] sits out there remaining at the moment because we are still in discussions with WSP about resolving the north side fendering,” Huggett said.
The lawsuits mean that for the taxpayer costs are still unknown, said Ross Crockford, director of the watchdog group johnsonstreetbridge.org. “Obviously the companies are not satisfied with the situation as it is right now and so the project is not completely over. It’s still going on and there are still outstanding issues,” Crockford said.
PCL lawyer Michael Demers did not respond to a request for comment by deadline.
Latest cost estimate for the bridge, not including fendering, is about $105 million. When citizens voted in the 2010 bridge referendum, the estimate was $63 million

I was grossed out thinking that It was actually blood and cleaned it up. 

This morning I was boiling water for tea and my cat knocked some of the water onto the countertop while I was in the other room, I came back into the kitchen and noticed that there were very similar red spots in that water to the dried ones I had found in the bathroom previously. To test this I then went to the sink dipped my hands in the tap water and put a small amount on the counter again. Within several seconds it began to develop similar red spots. My online research on the matter so far makes me think its an excess of Iron in the water. Its just city water as far as I know and I have never encountered this anywhere else in Victoria. Has anyone experienced this? is it safe to drink? There is no metallic smell or taste or any sludge buildup in the back of the toilet either so I'm wondering if I can even say indefinitely that it is iron. 

Any information would be helpful!
